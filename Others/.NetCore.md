# SOLID

    S - Single responsibiliy [there shouldn't be more then one reason to change]
    O - 
    L -
    I - 
    D - Dependency Inversion Principle [High level modules shouldn't depend on low level modules. Both should depend on abstractions]
                                        Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
